React Weather App
This is a single-file React application that provides a modern, responsive user interface for checking both the current weather and a 3-day forecast for any city in the world.

The app is built using modern React hooks and functional components and is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-first design.

Features
Current Weather: Displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and the amount of rain that fell over a certain period of time.

3-Day Forecast: Provides a detailed forecast for the next three days in 3-hour increments.

City Search: Allows users to search for weather by city name.

Interactive Map: Users can click on any location on the map to get its weather information.

Responsive Design: The user interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

Dynamic Icons: Weather icons are dynamically displayed based on the forecast conditions.

How It Works
The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It uses two key endpoints:

Current Weather Endpoint: Used to get the real-time weather data for the specified city.

5-Day Forecast Endpoint: Provides detailed forecast data in 3-hour blocks, which is then rendered in the forecast section of the app.

The UI is built with React, and state management is handled using the useState hook to keep the weather data and user input in sync. The mapping functionality uses Leaflet.js to display an interactive map, and the Nominatim service for reverse geocoding to find city names from coordinates.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.

OpenWeatherMap API: The data source for all weather information.

Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

Nominatim: A geocoding service to find location information from coordinates.

File Structure
The entire application is self-contained in a single file: weather-app. This includes all React components, styling, and logic, making it easy to run and share.

Getting Started
To run this app, simply copy the code and save it as a .jsx file. The application is ready to run and does not require any additional setup or package installations, assuming Tailwind CSS and React are available in your environment.
